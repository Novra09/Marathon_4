He ceases to be the source of laughter and entertainment of his class and he tries to stay away from any unwanted attention, However, due to his devotion and love for Aika, he makes quite assertive decision at times in order to help her.
        Wataru also demonstrates traits of social acumen and experience.

This continued until when one day while chasing her on the way to school, he nearly got hit by a soccer ball which woke him up from his fantasy and made him realize he is not worthy and decided to give up on her.</p>
